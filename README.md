K.I.M.C.H.I.

A drag-and-drop programming language, similar to Scratch or Snap!, but geared more heavily towards evaluation rather than statements (i.e., conforming to a functional paradigm rather than a procedural or imperative paradigm). There are be 2 major modes: a variable “sandbox” where functions and atoms (fundamental values like 7, A, False, None) can be dragged in and out of each other and into a set of slots representing (limited) variables, which can be evaluated; and a function creator where a new function can be defined with up to 9 inputs by composing other functions and atoms.

How to run: make sure that PreFunctions.txt, KLOGO.png, Axis.py and cmu_112_graphics.py are all in the same folder as KIMCHI5.py, then open and run KIMCHI5.py in the IDE of your choice (so long as it supports cmu_112_graphics.py). You will enter a splash screen with 3 buttons (and a hidden 4th one with a surprise). Clicking on ENTER will swittch to the Variable Sandbox mode. From there, you can toggle back to the splash screen or Function Creator mode, as well as toggle the background, create a new save, clear, or clear the sandbox. Clicking on LOAD will switch to the loading mode, where already saved <<KimchiFile>> txt files can be loaded with blocks and function definitions. Ideally have the 8 demo files in thet same folder as KIMCHI5.py to see what they do. Clicking on TUTORIAL will enter tutorial mode, where a more in depth explanation of how the blocks work is available.
	
Libraries/Modules to install/have in folder: math, random, copy, TKinter, 112 graphics file, Axis, OS, functools

Shortcuts: The hidden 4th button in the Splash Screen is the KIMCHI text. Clicking on it will take you to Drawing mode, where you can create your own custom background, which will appear as one of the toggle-able options in the Sandbox and which will be saved with your file. The 8 demo files demonstrate the full breadth of the pre-built functions, as well as a couple custom functions that can be built (the code for creating these custom functions would be shown next to the function itself... but this part of saving/loading tends to glitch out). I reccomend quickly looking over listDemo1 and predDemo before hopping on over to arithmeticDemo and trying to replicate the pythag or factorial function using the Function Creation mode (the green plus sign). If you load a file and it "sticks," simply go back to the loading mode and try loading it again.

Competitive Analysis: Scratch, and it’s less famous cousin Snap! are well established tools for getting individuals acquainted with computer science in a fun atmosphere without having to dredge them in coding. While they have a rather heavy emphasis on the animation side (since it is the most kid-friendly), mine will have a much greater emphasis on the functional paradigm of coding, since a great limitation of my language will be the fact that almost everything is an expression rather than a statement. Even though some of my pre-built functions use for loops, they can only be used in an evaluative form. As a result, mine still serves as a psychological warm up to functional side of programming, which can be a jolt for those who are more familiar with the procedural and imperative, since the flow of data between functions is a more abstract concept than a statement saying DO THIS or an object storing some data.

Version Control Plan: I used my GitHub account to store the old versions that got re-written as well as occasional updates.
